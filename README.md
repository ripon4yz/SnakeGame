**Snake Game**  
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game, inspired by the game I loved playing during my childhood. The game features a black background, a red snake, and green food, providing a nostalgic experience. The player controls the snake to eat food and grow longer, all while avoiding collisions with the edges of the screen and itself. Enjoy reliving the excitement of this timeless game!
